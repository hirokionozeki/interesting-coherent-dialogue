Score the following response given the corresponding dialogue context on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where a score of zero means 'disengaging' and a score of 100 means 'very engaging'.
Assume the response immediately follows the dialogue context. 
Consider that engagingness of a response is defined by the following qualities: variety of response according to the context (such as responding to "Hi how are you?" with "I feel magnificent, because I just successfully defended my PhD! How are you?" instead of "Good, how are you?"), likelihood of encouraging the other participant to respond (such as 'I love legos! I like using them to make funny things. Do you like legos?' instead of 'I like legos.'), likelihood of encouraging a quality response from the other participant, interestingness, specificity, and likelihood of creating a sense of belonging for the other participant.
